# Sahyun bot

This is the implementation of the bot used in Sahyun's twitch channel:

## Usage

Here are some example commands and outputs:

## Architecture & design

The purpose of this bot is to manage the playlist of user requests while Sahyun is streaming.
It may also perform some other trivial tasks alongside.

For the sake of exercise, the bot is written using Python 3.8+. It uses poetry as build & dependency 
management tool.

install.bat should contain all the relevant commands & instructions which were used when setting up
the application for development & running. All instructions assume windows, as anyone using linux is
probably savvy enough to take care of such things on their own. Furthermore, most of the work is
described in guides & documentation of python or its tools. In some cases, information from a reddit
post was used: https://www.reddit.com/r/pycharm/comments/elga2z/using_pycharm_for_poetrybased_projects/
