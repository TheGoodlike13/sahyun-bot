This set of characters is brought to you by customsforge CDLCs. It's the exhaustive list (as of this writing) of
characters that are not a letter, digit or whitespace, but somehow found themselves on the artist or song title.

The CDLC above is said to have a broken link. If you try to download it, it will not succeed. But upon further
inspection, you can find that this link is actually two links combined together, with one of the links pasted
right into the middle of another. It can be a bit confusing, but if you try to untangle both of the links,
you will be able to find the real and working one.

I discovered this when inspecting the domains for direct download links. This link was the only one that did
not have a proper domain.
