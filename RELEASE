Version 1.0.1:

* Fixed a bug where request queue was considered unavailable because it was empty
* Fixed a bug where migration was printing incorrect index name for deletion
* Added 'quit' as another way to stop bot besides 'exit()'
* Fixed a bug where elasticsearch would fail to pick random value from a pool of >10K results

Version 1.0.0:

I am taking a break from working on the bot, and all the initial functionality is finished.
Here's a list of stuff the bot does for now:

* runs locally (no deployment)
* REPL mode (access to all modules for debug/trying something out)
* commands via console
* commands via IRC (twitch chat)
* dynamically loaded commands
* downtime configuration for commands
* CDLCs from customsforge
* CDLC dumping/loading to JSON file
* CDLC search via elasticsearch
* user ranks via elasticsearch
* CDLC request queue
* CDLC links in browser/clipboard
* twitch follower check
* list of twitch hosts
