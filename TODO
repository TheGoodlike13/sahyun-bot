IRC
    connect on start
    reconnect automatically or on command
    if connection takes too long, restart

ELASTIC
    automatically refresh data, as well as manual command

TWITCH
    manage API keys properly

COMMANDS
    same as original bot

WEIRD IDEAS
    DL the CDLC automatically?
    Place it in the correct folder?


All functionality should be optional when possible.

elastic instructions in readme or install.bat? readme better imo

Allow to configure: worker threads

Remove _id from cdlc, add during load instead
