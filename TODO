All functionality should be optional when possible.

Allow to configure: worker threads, dump file (also, general cleanup)

Replace str.format with f' strings: f'{something}'

Retry on 403?

console should be WARN, bot.log INFO, requests DEBUG; debug_ex prints to console when NOT silent, otherwise files?

bot_modules should be re-written to be simpler & reusable from other modules
Replace skip_while with itertools
Reindex - some fields got fucked
